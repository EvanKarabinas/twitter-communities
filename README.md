### A tool to analyze the communities that form between Twitter users and how information spreads in those communities.

The purpose of this thesis is to study the Twitter networks that form around the two most popular political party accounts in Greece, so that we can extract information about the most important Twitter users in each network, the communities that form between the users, the context of each community based on the most used hashtag in the community and iinally the way these communities evolve in time. Also, we present a set of efiicient techniques we used to collect data from Twitter and how we saved this data so that it is easily accessible. All the code parts of this is thesis are implemented in Python3. To connect to the TwitterAPI we used the Tweepy library. The construction of the graphs was made using the NetworkX module. To visualise the graphs we used the graph visualisation tool Gephi.
